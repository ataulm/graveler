========

so, there was a project called GOLEM (**G**eneralised **O**nto**L**ogical **E**nvironments for **M**ulti-**A**gent **S**ystems) (will link when the website is back up, but search DICE group at RHUL, Kostas Stathis, Stefano Bromuri).

I made GOLEMlite (aka. **geodude**) as part of my MSc thesis.

This is the iteration to that hopefully. It'll be purely Java, so a bit regressed from GOLEMlite which allowed Prolog. It'll be packaged as a jar which can be imported into Java projects to be used as a simple Agent framework. The aim would be to provide an easy to use, well-tested and maintainable tool which will help CS students learn about Intelligent Agent.
