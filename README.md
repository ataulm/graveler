========

so, there was a project called GOLEM (**G**&#8203;eneralised **O**&#8203;nto&#8203;**L**&#8203;ogical **E**&#8203;nvironments for **M**&#8203;ulti-**A**&#8203;gent **S**&#8203;ystems).*

I made GOLEMlite (aka. **geodude**) as part of my MSc thesis.

This is the iteration to that hopefully. It'll be purely Java, so a bit regressed from GOLEMlite which allowed Prolog. It'll be packaged as a jar which can be imported into Java projects to be used as a simple Agent framework. The aim would be to provide an easy to use, well-tested and maintainable tool which will help CS students learn about Intelligent Agent.
